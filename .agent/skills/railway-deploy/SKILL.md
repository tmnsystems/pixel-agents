# Railway Standard Operating Procedures — FreedomBot

> A step-by-step guide for deploying and managing your FreedomBot AI agent on Railway.
> Works with any FreedomBot instance — just plug in your own project details.

## Your Project Details

Fill these in once, then reference them throughout:

| Key                   | Your Value                                                       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project Name**      | FreedomBot                                                       |
| **Service Name**      | FreedomBot Service                                               |
| **Environment**       | `production`                                                     |
| **Project Directory** | /Users/alethea/Documents/AntiGravity/PureCore                    |
| **Dashboard URL**     | https://railway.com/project/e6bfc5f5-91cd-4a15-96d2-ea5357702bed |

## Prerequisites

1. **Railway CLI installed**

   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   railway --version
   ```

2. **Logged in**

   ```bash
   railway login --browserless
   ```

3. **Project linked** — run this inside your FreedomBot folder (`/Users/alethea/Documents/AntiGravity/PureCore`):

   ```bash
   railway link
   ```

   Select your project and service when prompted.

4. **Environment variables set on Railway**
   For each variable in your `.env`, push it to Railway:

   ```bash
   railway variables set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your-token"
   railway variables set OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key"
   # ... repeat for all env vars
   ```

## The Dev Cycle

```
1. Pause Railway  →  2. Test Locally  →  3. Deploy  →  4. Verify
```

### Phase 1: Pause Railway (Enter Dev Mode)

Before testing locally, **always pause the Railway service first.** Two bot instances polling the same Telegram token will fight over messages — some go to Railway, some to your laptop, neither works properly.

```bash
railway down
```

### Phase 2: Test Locally

Start the local dev server with hot-reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs your `bun --watch src/index.ts` script — auto-restarts on code changes. Interact with your bot on Telegram to test changes in real time.

When done, stop the local server (`Ctrl+C`).

### Phase 3: Deploy to Railway

Once you're happy with the changes:

**3a. Type-check** to catch errors before deploying:

```bash
bun run typecheck
```

**3b. Set new env vars** (if you added any):

```bash
railway variables set NEW_VAR_NAME="value"
```

**3c. Deploy:**

```bash
railway up --detach
```

This triggers a Docker build on Railway. Takes ~60–90 seconds. The bot briefly goes offline during rebuild, then reconnects automatically.

### Phase 4: Verify

Wait ~60 seconds for the build to finish, then check logs:

```bash
railway logs --lines 40
```

**All of these should appear:**

- `✅ Soul loaded (soul.md)`
- `✅ Connected as @freedombot_bot`
- `✅ Heartbeat scheduled`
- No crash traces or unhandled errors

## Quick Reference

| Task               | Command                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Pause the live bot | `railway down`                      |
| Start local dev    | `npm run dev`                       |
| Type-check         | `bun run typecheck`                 |
| Deploy to Railway  | `railway up --detach`               |
| View live logs     | `railway logs --lines 100`          |
| Set a new env var  | `railway variables set KEY="value"` |
| List all env vars  | `railway variables`                 |
| Open dashboard     | `railway open`                      |

## Things to Know

### Short and Long-Term Memory

Railway's filesystem is **ephemeral**. Your short-term conversation memory and vector semantic memory have been securely cloud-hosted via **Supabase**. They act as FreedomBot's external cloud-brain and persist across all container deploys automatically.

### Files that get deployed (via Dockerfile)

`src/`, `tsconfig.json`, `soul.md`, `mcp.json`, `package.json`, `bun.lock`

### Files that do NOT get deployed (via .dockerignore)

`.env`, `node_modules/`, `vector_store.db`, `memory.db`, `*.db`, `bot.log`, `bot.pid`

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                           | What to do                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Build failed**                  | Run `railway logs --lines 100` — look for Bun or TypeScript errors |
| **Bot crashes on startup**        | Check for missing env vars: `railway variables`                    |
| **Messages going to wrong place** | You're running two instances — `railway down` before `npm run dev` |
| **Need to rollback**              | Fix the issue locally, then `railway up --detach` again            |

## AI Agent Skill (for Antigravity / Gemini users)

If you're using an AI coding agent, drop the `SKILL.md` and `deploy.md` workflow files into your project's `.agent/` folder. The agent will then handle the full pause → test → deploy → verify cycle for you — you never have to touch Railway yourself. Just say "deploy" and it handles the rest.

- **Skill location:** `.agent/skills/railway-deploy/SKILL.md`
- **Workflow location:** `.agent/workflows/deploy.md`
